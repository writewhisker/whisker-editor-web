## What Was Deferred

The following features require backend infrastructure and were deferred:

1. **Real-time Collaboration** - Requires WebSocket server
2. **Cloud Sync** - Requires backend API
3. **Conflict Resolution** - Requires merge algorithms
4. **User Authentication** - Requires auth service
5. **Presence Indicators** - Requires real-time server

These can be added when backend infrastructure is available.

---

## Technical Notes

### Local-First Approach
- All collaboration features work locally
- Export/import enables sharing
- No server required for core functionality
- Future: Can sync to backend when available

### Data Storage
- Comments stored in localStorage
- Change log stored in localStorage
- Collaboration metadata in story JSON
- All data included in project exports

## Next Steps

Phase 4B is complete. Continuing with Phase 4C: Analytics & Insights.
