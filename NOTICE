originally developed at https://github.com/jmspring/whisker.

LICENSE CHANGE NOTICE
=====================

This visual editor is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0
(AGPLv3), which differs from the MIT license used by the core whisker library.

IMPORTANT: This code was developed specifically for the visual editing interface
and has always been developed separately on the feature/visual-editor branch.
This code has NEVER been released under the MIT license.

PROJECT HISTORY
===============

- Original whisker project: https://github.com/jmspring/whisker (MIT License)
- Feature development began: 2025-10 on feature/visual-editor branch
- Phases 1-3 completed: 2025-10 (7,675 lines added)

WHY AGPLV3?
===========

The visual editor is licensed under AGPLv3 to ensure that improvements are
shared with the community, especially for hosted/SaaS deployments.

Section 13 of AGPLv3 (Network Use) requires that:
  "If you modify the Program, your modified version must prominently offer
  all users interacting with it remotely through a computer network an
  opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source of your version."

This means if you:
- Host the editor as a web service
- Modify the editor code
- Allow users to access it remotely

Then you MUST make your modified source code available to those users.

This protects the community while still allowing commercial use.

RELATIONSHIP TO whisker-core

The whisker-core library remains MIT licensed:
  https://github.com/writewhisker/whisker-core

You can:
- Use whisker-core in proprietary applications (MIT allows this)
- Use this visual editor in proprietary applications, BUT:
  - Any modifications to the editor must be released under AGPLv3
