Shafts of colored light stream through stained glass windows, painting the dusty air in hues of crimson and gold. At the far end, an enormous throne sits empty, waiting.',
    'The marketplace bustles with life and energy. Vendors call out their wares from wooden stalls draped in colorful fabric. The mingled scents of exotic spices, fresh bread, and roasting meat fill the air. Children weave through the crowd, laughing and playing, while merchants haggle animatedly with customers. Above it all, the azure sky is dotted with white clouds.',
    'The library is a labyrinth of towering bookshelves that seem to reach endlessly upward. Leather-bound volumes of every size and color pack the shelves, their spines bearing titles in languages both familiar and strange. The air is thick with the smell of old paper and ink. A single reading desk sits in a pool of lamplight, surrounded by the quiet whispers of knowledge.',

    'Original: "She said she was scared."\nImproved: "\'I\'m terrified,\' she whispered, her voice trembling."\n\nSuggestions:\n- Show, don\'t tell - use dialogue and action\n- Added sensory details (voice trembling)\n- More impactful word choice ("terrified" vs "scared")\n- Creates more immersive scene',
    'Original: "The monster was very big and scary."\nImproved: "The creature loomed overhead, its massive form casting a shadow that swallowed the entire clearing."\n\nSuggestions:\n- Replace vague adjectives with specific imagery\n- Use active verbs ("loomed", "casting")\n- Add concrete details (shadow, clearing)\n- Create visual impact through description',

    'Plot Twist Ideas:\n\n1. **The Betrayal**: The mentor figure who has been guiding the protagonist is actually working for the antagonist\n2. **Hidden Identity**: The protagonist discovers they are related to their greatest enemy\n3. **False Victory**: What seemed like the final triumph was actually part of the villain\'s plan all along\n4. **Time Loop**: The story has been repeating, and the protagonist starts remembering previous iterations\n5. **Unreliable Reality**: Events the protagonist believed happened were actually illusions or dreams',
    'Character Development Ideas:\n\n1. **The Reluctant Hero**: Starts selfish, gradually learns to care about others through consequences of their actions\n2. **The Fallen Mentor**: Once a hero, now bitter and cynical - can the protagonist restore their faith?\n3. **The Double Agent**: Seemingly loyal companion with divided loyalties - which side will they choose?\n4. **The Redeemed Villain**: Antagonist who realizes the error of their ways and seeks redemption\n5. **The Corrupted Innocent**: Pure character gradually tempted by power or revenge',
    'Setting Expansion Ideas:\n\n1. **The Undercity**: A hidden layer beneath the main city where outcasts and criminals dwell\n2. **The Floating Islands**: Sky-bound settlements connected by rope bridges and airships\n3. **The Memory Gardens**: A place where thoughts and dreams take physical form\n4. **The Timeless Library**: A repository where past, present, and future coexist\n5. **The Borderlands**: A shifting, unstable region between realities',

Review timeline references in passages 12-15\n2. Add a scene where protagonist learns the crucial information\n3. Consider adding passage notes for complex timelines',
    'Consistency Analysis:\n\n✓ Character Voice: Dialogue style matches established personality\n⚠ Plot Threads: "The stolen artifact" mentioned in passage 3 hasn\'t been resolved\n✓ World Rules: Technology level consistent throughout\n⚠ Character Relationships: Sudden shift in Character B\'s attitude toward protagonist needs explanation\n✓ Descriptions: Location details match across multiple visits\n\nSuggestions:\n1. Plan resolution for the artifact subplot\n2. Add a scene explaining the relationship change\n3. Use variable tracking for important plot threads',
    'Quality Review:\n\n✓ Pacing: Good balance of action and exposition\n⚠ Repetitive Phrases: "Suddenly" used 8 times - consider alternatives\n✓ Choice Meaningfulness: Player decisions have clear consequences\n⚠ Dead Ends: 3 passages lead nowhere - add more connections\n✓ Branching Depth: Good variety of paths\n\nEnhancements:\n1. Vary sentence openings for better flow\n2. Create more choice consequences in passages 18, 22, 31\n3. Review passages marked as "TODO"',
